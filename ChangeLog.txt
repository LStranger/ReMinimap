2015.07.04 - 1.3.7
- Fixed update of minimap position on /rmm [on/off], it was kept at place.
- Added few missing minimap elements to the list to enable moving.
- Added hack to unbind objectives frame from minimap to not move it with the

  frames still are bound to the minimap, the game itself binds them each time
  they appear, and to override that requires too much bigger work than such
  simple addon can do.
