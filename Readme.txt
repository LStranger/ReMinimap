== About ==

ReMinimap was originally created to revive the dLx Minimap mod by 'grimman' which was abandoned. Various features from Square Minimap (by Davik) were included, and community feedback has asked for features from or similar to other minimap mods such as simpleMinimap. ReMinimap Light is the pure dLx Minimap replacement, with only the addition of scroll wheel zoom support, but is otherwise featuresless; hence the name 'Light'.
